PRE-REQUISITES
1. Server up and running (Ubuntu 20.04)
2. SSH daemon installed
3. Python3 installed
4. SSH-Keys configured for remote administration

GOAL
- Automate the installation of a WordPress site on a remote server

CONDITIONS
- Site should be able to restart when server is rebooted (at Docker level ? (restart policy/live restore), at system level ? (verify Docker daemon gets started at boot))
- No secrets should be left in clear (make use of Ansible Vault)
- Data should persist when server rebooted (use of Docker bind mounts or volumes ?)
- Possibility to deploy site on several servers simultaneously (easy with Ansible inventory)
- Possibility to only install one service on the server -> Make code modular (use of Ansible tags)
- Secure and limited access to server (firewall + basic security setup)
- Install all services needed for Wordpress (MySQL, PHP, ...) with dedicated Dockerfiles
- Use TLS (Transport Layer Security) for server
- When URL requested, redirect to correct site
- Use variables to make configurations easier

STEPS

1) Install Ansible on control node and Ansible Docker module (community.docker) -> ansible-galaxy install community.docker
2) Update and upgrade system packages (apt upgade + update)
3) Setup system and security
  3a) Set timezone to Europe/Paris
  3b) Setup firewall
  3c) Disable root SSH auth + only allow key authentification for other user
4) Setup user
  4a) Add sudo-user
5) Install Docker
6) Push Dockerfiles to server
  6a) Push Wordpress Dockerfile
  6b) Push PhpMyAdmin Dockerfile
  6c) Push MySQL Dockerfile
7)
 ) Create wordpress site
